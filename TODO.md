### `This is where we can make notes of questions we have`
#
* We can ask questions using the tilda key ` for highlighting, and answer using the asterisk key * to make a solution.
* This is an attempt to making the project slightly easier for when we can't hop on discord or just have questions about files and can directly link them using [the link method](TODO.md).
* It is recommended you have a status of your question to keep up for recommendations. The user who answers your question and knows they're correct may change the status of the question from `unsolved` to `solved`.

### `Do we need the csv and wav files anymore?`
#
- current status - `SOLVED`

### `Make the Trail Slowly get smaller as the line depreciates to the end. (Like when a base hits high and then slowly drops frequency)`
